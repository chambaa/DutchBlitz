# DutchBlitz
Application made to keep track of Dutch Blitz scores

This Application is created to run on Qt Creator using a IOS simulator.
In order for the IOS simulator to run you must have xcode downloaded and installed.

This application allows the user to enter in the number of players inbetween 2 and 8 and 
lets the user set the score they are playing to.
The user can then enter in the players names and scores per round and the application adds the score to the total.
When one of the players hits or exceeds the playing to value the game stops and takes the users to a page of final rankings.
